This is a simple quiz app that afford user interactions.
Click 'Start' to start the game, and answer the questions preloaded (eventually from a server).
Then, when the correct answer is chosen, the background colour would change from neutral (blue) to green, otherwise to red.
After each question is answered, the "Next" button would appear to prompter user to go to next questions.

When all the questions are answered, a new button with "Try again" would appear.


**Bugs to be fixed**:

When user choose the right answer, if he clicked another wrong answer button,
the game background will turn to red, and unable to turn back when the correct answer is chosen again.

If this bug happened in the last question, then both 'Try again' and 'Next' button will be displayed.
